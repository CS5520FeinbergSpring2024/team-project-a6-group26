# Most intriguing design features: 
# Emoji Calendar: 
Our interactive calendar displays an emoji for each day, offering a quick and emotive snapshot of the user's mood history, promoting frequent use and personal reflection. Beneath the calendar, daily inspirational quotes are dynamically displayed, fetched via an API integration, enriching the user's daily interaction. For journal updates, users can easily update their journal by clicking on a prominent emoji face in the main page to add an entry for today, or by selecting specific dates on the calendar. Users can also effortlessly navigate and search past entries by searching past months. 

# Journal System: 
The journaling system offers a design that is both simple and comprehensive, enabling users to intuitively record their mood with emojis, upload photos, and take notes. All data stored in a specific journal—whether emoji, photo, or note—can be updated or deleted individually or collectively. The interfaces for updating and deleting journal entries maintain consistency with the journal creation process. Additionally, the system enhances user engagement by featuring a pop-up window that indicates other users may be experiencing similar feelings on the same day.

# Mood Statistics: 
The Mood Statistics feature in our app provides users with a visual summary of their emotional patterns, using mood emojis as data points. It automatically compiles and displays the frequency of each emoji used in journal entries over a selected period, typically a month. This insight is visually represented through a RecyclerView, where each mood emoji is accompanied by a horizontal progress bar and a percentage, illustrating the proportion of each mood relative to the total entries. Data is sourced in real-time from Firebase, ensuring up-to-date and personalized statistics. By offering a straightforward and engaging way to track emotional trends, the Mood Statistics feature enhances self-awareness and encourages users to reflect on their mental well-being, making it a crucial component of our app's user-centric design.
# Secure Account and Data Management: 
Users can sign up, login to the app to gain access to data and features, which was implemented with Firebase authentication. Only authenticated users that logged in with email and password can access app content. Additionally, data is secure and privacy is addressed. Authenticated users only have access to their own journals. Users will have access to data like how many people shared the same emoji on a day to boost engagement but the data is aggregated and non-identifying for privacy purposes. Another aspect of secure data and privacy practice is that we have included deleting accounts and clearing data as setting options so users have control of what stays within our database and can wipe any personal data by deleting the account or clearing the data.
